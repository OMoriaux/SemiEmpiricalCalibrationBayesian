BK Pinhole

Calibration data of a pinhole probe mounted B&K microphone. Two calibration steps are included: one with the calibrator
on a flush-mounted reference microphone (same B&K), the other with the calibrator mounted over the pinhole probe of
interest. The calibrator is a plane-wave tube with a calibrator microphone (another B&K microphone) mounted in a
side-branch connected to the main tube of the calibrator. On top of the calibrator main tube sits a speaker.
Fake unsteady wall-pressure measurements are included as well, to provide an example of how the TF must be applied to
the data.

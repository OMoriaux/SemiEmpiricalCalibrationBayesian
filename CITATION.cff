abstract: >-
  Unsteady surface pressures shed light on the turbulent
  structures of boundary layer flow, which dictate for a
  large part the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of
  aerodynamic bodies submersed in a flow. Remote microphone
  probes (RMP), e.g., pinhole probes, provide advantages
  compared to flush-mounted probes because of their reduced
  sensing area.

  However, they feature a distinct transfer function (TF)
  that needs to be taken into account for accurate pressure
  measurements. Many empirical calibration techniques for
  such probes introduce spurious resonance into the
  calibration, which propagate to the measurements. In this
  study, a semi-empirical calibration method is proposed
  with the aim of removing the spurious resonance in a
  physics-driven manner that is less reliant on the
  operator. Bayesian inversion is used to fit an analytic
  model for the TF of the RMP to the empirical calibration
  data.

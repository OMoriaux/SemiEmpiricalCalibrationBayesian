# Semi-Empirical Calibration using Bayesian inference
A novel post-processing method for empirical calibration data of remote microphone probes (RMP), 
using Bayesian inference (BI) and pre-existing analytical model for the frequency response of the considered probe.
http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:7cfd53ce-c443-43af-a0d3-205fa5468e8c

Contains code to process empirical calibration data of RMPs, and unsteady pressure measurements with these RMPs.
Also includes the code implementation of the Bergh & Tijdeman [1965] model and Whitmore [2006] model for the transfer function of pneumatic systems.
As for the BI, a simple Metropolis-Hastings Markov-chain Monte Carlo is provided, as well as helper functions to pre-process the data etc.


## 1. Project structure
The code is meant to explain the presented method, and highlight its strengths. 

### a. ./Source
The core functions of the method are written in the Source directory. 
- **BayesianInferenceFunctions**: Code used to couple data with models using Bayesian Inference (BI); Metropolis-Hastings (MH), Markov-chain Monte Carlo (McMC).
- **BerghTijdemanWhitmoreModels**: Implementations of the Bergh & Tijdeman [1965] and Whitmore [2006] models.
- **CalibrationMeasurement**: Code used to ingest calibration and unsteady pressure measurement data from TDMS files. ! REQUIRES npTDMS
- **PlottingFunctions**: Functions used to plot the results of the TDMS data and McMC fitting results.
- **ProcessingFunctions**: Functions to process the TDMS data into power spectral density, transfer functions etc.

### b. Main (SemiEmpiricalCalibrationBayesian)
Example code, using these functions, are provided in the main directory (SemiEmpiricalCalibrationBayesian):
- **TestDataIngest**: Example of how to use Source/CalibrationMeasurement to process calibration (and measurement) data.
- **BK_Pinhole_McMC**: The semi-empirical calibration method using the Whitmore model, applied to the example calibration data. Outputs the results to *./McMC_Output*.
- **Process_McMC**: Further processing from the McMC results from BK_Pinhole_McMC. Outputs figures to *./McMC_Figures*.
- **ParaDRAM_BK_Pinhole_McMC**: Similar to *BK_Pinhole_McMC*, albeit using the ParaDRAM implementation of ParaMonte. No processing code provided.

### c. TutorialsInJupyter
These are Jupyter notebooks that aim to explain in a more step-by-step method the problem with idea behind the proposed method, and how to apply the method, and process its results.
- **Step 1**: Similar to TestDataIngest, where one reads the calibration data and observes spurious resonance.
- **Step 2**: A short overview of how the Whitmore model works, e.g., its parameters.
- **Step 3**: Setting up the semi-empirical calibration method for the example dataset.
- **Step 4**: Processing the results of the semi-empirical calibration method.
- **Extra - Basics of Bayesian Inference** (**WORK IN PROGRESS**): Meant to explain basics of MH McMC, e.g., the step size of the sampling Gaussian.

## 3. Required Python install and packages
- Python 3.9 or newer (still testing older versions)
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas (tdms files are read into Pandas DataFrames, arrays with named columns)
- npTDMS (reads LabVIEW VI output files, i.e. tdms files)

! npTDMS will need to be installed in most cases. Either install the package in the user's prefered manner or simply run ">>> pip install npTDMS" in the Python console.
